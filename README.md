# jam-oracle

Have you ever sat in your car, caught in a terrible traffic jam, and asked yourself: **"Could I have avoided this? What time does the rush hour really start? Maybe if I left a little earlier..."**?

Look no futher! **Jam Oracle** is a telegram bot that predicts and visualizes traffic congestion on optimal routes for any driving commute.

Given a start and end location, Jam Oracle **tells you exactly when traffic picks up or subsides** for the top 3 possible routes. 

See how well our predictors do, and use the information to plan your next trip!


## Inspiration

[Beat The Jam]([/guides/content/editing-an-existing-page](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/beat-the-jam/id1204898821&ved=2ahUKEwiizLG9pYaNAxU-xTgGHVcCKH8QFnoECBMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1BCjngzYGpw1JzQ87Uw_VC)), but for arbitary places.

## Approaches considered 

Google Maps API Historical Data:
Google Maps API does not provide direct access to historical traffic data. To obtain historical trends, youâ€™d need to build your own dataset by periodically querying the API and storing the results over time. Not viable for user-facing app but good for regression insights.

Google Maps API Predictive Data:
The Directions API can offer predictive travel times if you supply a future departure time. By using parameters like departure_time (set to a future time) along with the traffic_model (e.g., "best_guess", "optimistic", "pessimistic"), you can get an estimate of congestion-based delays.

## TODOs

After 24 hours, give users a more accurate graph of **how traffic actually played out that day.** 

Provide app links to google maps navigation for each possible route.

## Local Running Instructions

*to remind myself because im a noob programmer and i dont know how to run a python file*

Create python virtual environment
`python3 -m venv myenv`

Activate it
`source myenv/bin/activate`

Install dependencies
'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Run python
`python3 bot.py`
