# jam-oracle

Have you ever sat in your car, caught in a terrible traffic jam, and asked yourself: **"Could I have avoided this? What time does the rush hour really start? Maybe if I left a little earlier..."**?

Look no futher! **Jam Oracle** is a telegram bot that visualises traffic congestion for your frequently taken routes. 

Given a start and end location, Jam Oracle plots a predictive graph based on historical to **tell you exactly when traffic picks up or subsides** for the top 3 possible routes. After 24 hours, you'll recieve a more accurate graph of **how traffic actually played out that day.** 

See how well our predictors do, and use the information to plan your next trip!


## Ideation

"beat the jam is really good for getting to JB and back. what if we could create congestion graph for any two arbitary places?"

Given a route between two locations commutable by car/bus, can we graph the expected and current delay time added by traffic congestion against time of the day?

Google Maps API Historical Data:
Google Maps API does not provide direct access to historical traffic data. To obtain historical trends, youâ€™d need to build your own dataset by periodically querying the API and storing the results over time. Not viable for user-facing app but good for regression insights.

Google Maps API Predictive Data:
The Directions API can offer predictive travel times if you supply a future departure time. By using parameters like departure_time (set to a future time) along with the traffic_model (e.g., "best_guess", "optimistic", "pessimistic"), you can get an estimate of congestion-based delays.
